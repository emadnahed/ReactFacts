# React App Template

This is a simple React app template that you can use as a starting point for your projects. It includes a basic structure with a navigation bar, main content area, and footer.

## Installation

To use this template, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, you can download or clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server and open the app in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

* `public/`: This directory contains the HTML file that is used as a template for the app. You can modify this file to add any meta tags or other elements that you need.
* `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the app.
  * `components/`: This directory contains the individual components that make up the app. Each component is defined in its own file.
  * `App.js`: This is the main component that renders the navigation bar, main content area, and footer.
  * `index.js`: This is the entry point for the app. It renders the `App` component and attaches it to the DOM.

## Components

The app includes the following components:

* `Navbar`: This is the navigation bar that appears at the top of the page. It includes a link to the home page.
* `Main`: This is the main content area of the page. It is empty by default, but you can add your own content here.
* `Footer`: This is the footer that appears at the bottom of the page. It includes a copyright notice.

## Styling

The app uses CSS for styling. The CSS files are located in the `src` directory and are imported into the corresponding component files.
